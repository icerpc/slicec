# Changelog

## [0.3.0] - 2024-2-7
### Added
- Added a new built-in generic type: `Result<S, F>` ([687]).
- Added support for compact enums ([686]).
- Added support for specifying explicit discriminants on enumerators with fields ([688]).
### Enhancements
- Allow `@param` tags to be used for documenting enumerator fields.
- Implemented the `Default` trait for `Ast` and `CompilationState`.
- Implemented the `Hash` trait for `SliceOptions` and `DiagnosticFormat`.
### Fixed
- Improved the cycle detection logic to correctly check fields in enumerators ([689]).
### Breaking
- Enums with fields can no longer be used as dictionary keys ([685]).
- `CompilationState` no longer implements `Send` (so we have greater freedom to evolve it).
### Changes
- The files `code_gen_util.rs` and `code_block.rs` were moved out of this crate (into `slicec-cs`).

## [0.2.1] - 2023-11-29
### Enhancements

### Added

- Added `is_within` to check if a `Location` is within a `Span` ([668]).
### Enhancements
- Added improved location tracking to messages and tags in doc comments ([670]).
- Improved the `Visitor` to automatically skip unpatched type references ([672]).
- Implemented the `Send` and `Sync` traits for some of the compiler's types.
### Fixed
- Fixed crash caused by compiling a Slice file with no module declaration.
### Breaking
- Interfaces can no longer be used as types in Slice definitions ([675]).
- Removed unused `is_numeric_or_bool` function from `Primitive`.
