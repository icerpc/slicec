# Changelog

## [0.3.2] - 2024-9-11
### Added
- Added support for computing source-hashes of Slice files, for tools to utilize ([696]).
### Fixed
- Fixed redefinition errors on containers triggering false-positives for their contents ([700]).
### Changed

### Fixed
- Improved the cycle detection logic to correctly check fields in enumerators ([689]).
### Breaking
- Enums with fields can no longer be used as dictionary keys ([685]).

### Enhancements
- Added improved location tracking to messages and tags in doc comments ([670]).
- Improved the `Visitor` to automatically skip unpatched type references ([672]).
- Implemented the `Send` and `Sync` traits for some of the compiler's types.
### Fixed
- Fixed crash caused by compiling a Slice file with no module declaration.
### Breaking
- Interfaces can no longer be used as types in Slice definitions ([675]).
