/// The `Visitor` trait is used to recursively visit through a tree of slice elements.
///
/// It automatically traverses through the tree, calling the various `visit_x` methods as
/// applicable. Elements that implement [Container] have 2 corresponding methods, `visit_x_start`
/// and `visit_x_end`. Non-container elements only have a single method: `visit_x`.
///
/// These methods are default implemented as no-ops, so implementors are free to only implement the
/// methods they need. Implementors also don't need to implement the tree traversal or recursive
/// visitation. This is handled automatically.
///
/// These methods are purely for the visitor's use, and shouldn't be called directly.
/// To actually visit an element, call `visit_with` on the element.
///
/// When a container is visited, first its `visit_x_start` method is called, then its
/// contents are recursively visited, and finally, its `visit_x_end` method is called.
/// For example, calling `visit_with` on a module containing a single struct would invoke:
/// - visit_module_start
///     - visit_struct_start
///         - visit_data_member (called once per data member, in the order they're defined)
///     - visit_struct_end
/// - visit_module_end
